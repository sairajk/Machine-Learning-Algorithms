# Mixture-Density-Networks

Mixture Density Networks (MDNs) are an interesting way to address multimodality (where the input-output hold a one-to-many relationship). In such cases, instead of directly predicting the output we predict the probability distribution of the output and sample the actual output from that distribution. Usually, the output distribution is a weighed mixture of several similar distributions and hence the name "Mixture Density Network".
